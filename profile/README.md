## Hello Everyone ##

The Biomedical Modeling, Visualization, and Image-guided Navigation Lab (BiMVisIGN) is a research facility located at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, NY, USA. Dr. Cristian Linte, an Associate Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Rochester Institute of Technology, NY, USA, oversees the lab. Our primary focus at BiMVisIGN is to address various challenges in biomedical image analysis and computer-guided intervention. Our research encompasses a wide range of topics, including cardiac image segmentation, liver registration, point cloud 3D registration, semi-supervised approaches for medical image analysis, learning with noisy labels in medical images, and active learning in medical images.
